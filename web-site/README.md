===============

"[Let's Make a Map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/)" is a great tutorial by [Mike Boswell](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) on how to render a map in a browser using D3 ([Data-Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/)).

The HTML files here build (slightly) on that tutorial, to create a choropleth based on UK postcodes.

[Cobbling together UK postcode area data](../../wiki/Cobbling-together-UK-postcode-area-data) is the most time-consuming part of the process - [displaying the data](../../wiki/Displaying-the-data) is almost trivial.
